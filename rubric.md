## Backend Technology
Performing - Application has fully functional two model API integration. It'd be really nice to have some more customized api endpoints that fits the needs for your application. Also there were some issues with saving plans, not sure if its associated with front-end/back-end or both. Additionally, it seems like plans/trips are exclusive of each other despite being associated in the backend.

## Frontend Technology
Excelling/Performing - Though you all voiced strong discomfort with angular throughout the week, the project has lots of great angular code within it. Got the angular maps to work, though I'm not sure how it integrates into the application beyond creating the trips. I really like your use of services, but encourage using ngResource! That way you only have to right one api endpoint.

## Code Quality
Performing - Codes pretty well formatted and separated. Would like to see more commenting, especially in a collaborative project such as this one. Also I'd check out john papas angular style guides.

## Deployment and Functionality
Excelling/Performing - Great job successfully deploying your app! It can be really tricky to deploy angular applications.

## Planning/Process/Submission
Excelling/Performing - Probably prefer more in the way of ERD's. But it seemed like the group gelled well together. I enjoyed reading through the readme. Also it was nice to see the planning process run pretty smoothly from scrum to scrum.
